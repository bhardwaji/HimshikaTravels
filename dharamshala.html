            <h3>KHAJIAR</h3>
            <p>
              Khajjiar is a hill station in the north Indian state of Himachal
              Pradesh. Dating from the 12th century, Khajji Nag Temple is
              dedicated to a serpent god. Nearby, the high-altitude Khajjiar
              Lake is surrounded by cedar forest. It is not difficult to
              understand why Khajjiar is often referred to as the
              mini-Switzerland of India. The wide grassy areas that meet dense
              forests of deodar and cedar forests, with cottages dotting them at
              occasional intervals, lend them an appearance similar to the Swiss
              countryside. Places To Visit In Khajjiar • Kalatop Wildlife
